# Talks night

Current host & sponsor for talks night is [Socrata](http://socrata.com).

Socrata's office is on the 6th floor at 705 5th Ave S. They ask that everyone sign in & get a nametag at the kiosk at the front of their office.

We have a code of conduct that we ask everyone, including participants, sponsors, organizers, & speakers, to follow: http://openseattle.org/conduct/

The event space is in the back of the Socrata office. There are signs to follow. 

There is a projector, and you can either use your own computer for slides or my computer will be available. We can usually accommodate hdmi, mini displayport, and usb-c ports for video.

We're open in terms of presentation format.

## Schedule

### 6 - 6:15 p.m.
People talk and get water/soda/food for the first 15 minutes and get started for real at about 6:15 p.m.

### 6:15 - 6:25 p.m.
The host does introductions, info about upcoming events & projects. 

### 6:25 - 6:35 p.m.
If there are projects that people can demo we sneak those in after introductions.

### 6:35 - 7:35 p.m.
Then we have the talks, and we try to keep them to 15-20 minutes each. I generally like to skip questions at the end, because after the talks there's plenty of time to talk one-on-one or form small discussion groups.

### 7:35 - 7:40 p.m.
After the talks we let anyone quickly announce a project they are working on in 1-2 sentences. This is a way for potential volunteers can find out what they might help with.

### 7:40 - 9 p.m.
We leave the rest of the time to allow people to talk, collaborate on projects, and ask follow-up questions of the speakers. If you're able to hang out and chat with people for a while that would be grand.
